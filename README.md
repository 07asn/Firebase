# JavaScript Homework

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates performing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** in JavaScript, including handling user interactions, dynamic rendering, and data management.

It also incorporates **Firebase** for data storage and **authentication** for user login and registration.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- **JavaScript**: For implementing CRUD operations, handling events, and manipulating the DOM.
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page, including forms and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience.
- **Firebase**: For storing product data and managing user authentication.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For implementing user login and registration.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **Create**: Adding new data dynamically using forms and rendering it in the DOM. (Products can be added and stored in Firebase)
- **Read**: Fetching and displaying data from Firebase and dynamically rendering it in the DOM.
- **Update**: Modifying existing data (e.g., product details) and updating it in Firebase and the DOM.
- **Delete**: Removing data (e.g., products) from Firebase and reflecting the change in the DOM.
- **Firebase Integration**: Using Firebase to store and manage product data in a NoSQL database and enabling real-time synchronization.
- **Authentication**: Implementing user login and registration using Firebase Authentication to secure access to the application.
